class BasePlugin(ABC):
  """Base class for creating plugins.

  Plugins provide a structured way to intercept and modify agent, tool, and
  LLM behaviors at critical execution points in a callback manner. While agent
  callbacks apply to a particular agent, plugins applies globally to all
  agents added in the runner. Plugins are best used for adding custom behaviors
  like logging, monitoring, caching, or modifying requests and responses at key
  stages.

  A plugin can implement one or more methods of callbacks, but should not
  implement the same method of callback for multiple times.

  Relation with [Agent callbacks](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/callbacks/):

  **Execution Order**
  Similar to Agent callbacks, Plugins are executed in the order they are
  registered. However, Plugin and Agent Callbacks are executed sequentially,
  with Plugins takes precedence over agent callbacks. When the callback in a
  plugin returns a value, it will short circuit all remaining plugins and
  agent callbacks, causing all remaining plugins and agent callbacks
  to be skipped.

  **Change Propagation**
  Plugins and agent callbacks can both modify the value of the input parameters,
  including agent input, tool input, and LLM request/response, etc. They work in
  the exactly same way. The modifications will be visible and passed to the next
  callback in the chain. For example, if a plugin modifies the tool input with
  before_tool_callback, the modified tool input will be passed to the
  before_tool_callback of the next plugin, and further passed to the agent
  callbacks if not short circuited.

  To use a plugin, implement the desired callback methods and pass an instance
  of your custom plugin class to the ADK Runner.

  Examples:
      A simple plugin that logs every tool call.
